<p>This café and créperie – with its brown-accented interior, wooden tables, black Tolix chairs, armchairs and a comfortable couch – feels like a modern French café. It feels comfortable enough to set up your laptop and work alone or with your team. On a pleasantly sunny winter afternoon, sit outside in the courtyard surrounded by potted plants and soak up the South African winter warmth in the whimsically charming setting.Perfect Cup also serves single-origin coffee from Ethiopia, Kenya, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia and Costa Rica. Start your morning with a café latté or Belgian hot chocolate with an exquisite sandwich (of seeded rye bread or French baguette) with fillings of delightful and irrisistable snacks. For lunch, opt for a French buckwheat gallette with our famous uniqe coffee drinks.Try the burgers made with 100% hand-pressed beef patties and freshly baked buns. </p>

		<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We started our cozy cafe in 1999 at a means of contributing to our community when we realised that the government did not do much for those in need especially in our area.The justic system was very biased at the time on how much one owned to determine how serious your problem will be handled. In order to counter that we began our protest against the government and made our fundraisings to give a those who suffered at the hands on that injustice by giving them food from our cafe.<br> Along with learning programs for the local children who needed help in pushing for bigger dreams.</p>
